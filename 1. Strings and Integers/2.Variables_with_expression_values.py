#1. Let's introduce two new variables named add, multi. Assign them expressions of sum (+) and product (*), respectively, of the previously declared variables robots, droids. If you have any trouble, use the hints below description.

#2. Utilizing expressions enables you to easily modify the values of robots, droids later while ensuring accurate values for add, multi. Feel free to adjust robots, droids and then press Check Solution. If you express add, multi correctly, you'll still complete this task successfully.

# Taken from mission Variable: Declaration and Value Setting

# 1. Declaring variable and setting their values
cyborgs = 10
# write your code here
robots = 2
droids = 5
# 2. Setting values for variables in a single line
# write your code here
robots, droids = 2, 5
# 3. Declaring with type annotation
cyborgs: int = 10
# write your code here
cyborgs: int = 10


# 1. Declaring new variables for sum and product and setting their values to expressions
# write your code here
add = robots + droids
multi = robots * droids
